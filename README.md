# GALwizard 

This is a basic c++ library implementing complex numbers, matrix operations and some numeric methods

## Currently Features

-   Fully working complex number system
-   Multiplying and other arithmetic operations on matrices and vectors
-   Transposing
-   Solving linear systems
-   Finding subspaces and nullspaces
-   Decomposing Matrices (QR, LPU) (working on SVD, SDS, EVD)
-   Finding projections onto subspaces
-   Performing Gausian elimination
-   Householder transformations
-   Givens rotations

## Planned Features 

- More Matrix decompositions (SVD, SDS, EVD)
- The solution to the Eigenvalue problem with QR iteration
- More efficient Linear System solutions
- Some statistical and probabilistic algorithms
- Finding roots of polynomials with Eigenvalues
- and many more exciting features...!

## Testing

This repo also includes a fully functional unit testing system, utilising the catch2 c++ unit testing framework. The relevant tests are all included in the `test` directory.
