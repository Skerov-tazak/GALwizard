For now the library includes these basic functionalities (ALL WORK IN PROGRESS):


-   Multiplying and other arithmetic operations on matrices and vectors
-   Transposing
-   Solving linear systems
-   Finding subspaces and nullspaces
-   Decomposing Matrices (QR, LPU) (working on SVD, SDS, EVD)
-   Finding projections onto subspaces
